Constant multipliers are ignored by Big O.For example,O(5n) with this rule bcomes 0(n)
As 'n' increases, only the term that grows the fastest should be kept.Eg,O(n + n^2) becomes O(n^2)
Remove the lower-order terms when there are several.Eg,O(n^2 + n) becomes O(n^2)
Algorithms that repeatedly split the problem in half are known as O(log n) algorithms
A recursive algorithm may result in exponential time if it is successful and makes numerous calls
