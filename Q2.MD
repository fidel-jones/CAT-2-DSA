The difference between arrays and linked lists in terms of memory aloocation is that arrays memory allocations are continuous in the sequence while for linked lists,memory is allocated dynamically
In terms of performance,arrays have fast accessing capability while that of linked lists is slower
Finally in terms of insertion and deletion, arrays insert and delete at the end while for linked lists, it is all done at the beginning
